Tune: The Caissons Go Rolling Along

**Chorus**
For it's "Hi! Hi! Hee!"
At the tampon factory.
Shot out your orders loud and clear. (Loud and clear!)
We've got small, medium, large,
We've got ones to fill a barge,
When the end of the month rolls around.

[Rhyming couplet]
When the end of the month rolls around.
[Rhyming couplet]
When the end of the month rolls around.

_(Repeat, always with two verses per chorus (although no need for them to be related).  Sometimes, the RA will expect people to have two verses when they put their mug up, other times they'll get one verse each from two people.)_

**Verses:**

You can tell my the smell
That she isn't feeling well.

You can tell by her stance
That there's cotton in her pants.

You can tell by her pout
That her eggs are falling out.

You can tell by her moaning
That she's losing hemoglobin.

You can tell by her frown
That she'll be going down.

You can tell by the bitchin'
That you'll put it in the kitchen.

You can tell by her walk
That you'll just sit around and talk.

You can tell by the string
There's a tampon in her thing.

When you're having bloody lovin'
There's no bun in the oven.

When there's a towel on the bed,
You know your tool is getting red.

When she's wearin' old stained things,
You'll be earning your red wings.
