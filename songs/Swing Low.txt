(RA:) Vessels down, hands together, and let's…

Swing low, _(hands together, held low, swinging side to side)_
sweet _(bunched fingers of one hand held to your lips)_
chariot _(mine shaking reins in front of you)_
Coming _(quick jacking- or jilling-off motion in front of your crotch)_
for _(hold up four fingers)_
to _(hold up two fingers)_
carry _(hands together, as if cradling a baby)_
me _(bring hands to your chest)_
home, _(hands make a pointed roof above your head)_
Swing low, sweet chariot _(same as before)_
Coming for to cary me home. _(same as before)_

I looked _(one hand shading eyes)_
over Jordan (Swish!), _(mime shooting a basket)_
and what did I see _(hands up shrug)_ (fake-coughed: Arabs!)
Coming for to carry me home? _(same as before)_
A band _(air guitar)_
of fucking _(air hump)_
angels _(flap elbows as wings)_
coming _(jack-/jill-off motion)_
after me, _(jog in place)_
Coming for to carry me home. _(same as before)_

If you  _(point in one direction with one elbow)_
get there _(point in the other direction with the other elbow)_
before I do, (Shit!) _(squat)_
Coming for to carry me home. _(same as before)_
Tell all my _(gesture at the rest of circle)_
fucking friends _(finger in/out of a )_
I'm coming _(jack-/jill-off motion)_
twice. _(hold up two fingers)_
Coming for to carry me home. _(same as before)_

(RA:) This hash is over, may the Hash go in peace.
(Reply:) May the Hash get a piece!
Tooo-night!

_Before declaring the hash over, the RA or a member of the pack can call for another variant—usually just the first verse with a parody of the lyrics or singing style, but using the same gestures._

_(People are probably ready to wrap things up at the end of circle (or you wouldn't be ending), so it's probably best to stick to 0–2 variations, or everyone will start to hate this song.)_

**Variations:**

"Double-time!"
_(singing and gestures really fast)_

"Ever other word"
Swing (pause), sweet (pause)…

"Scooby-Doo"
Ring row, reet rariot…
(Pack breaks into howling at some point during the verse.  Bonus points if any dogs on trail join in.)

"Women's verse"
_(Falsetto)_
Swing low, sweet chariot.
Cumming! Cumming! Cumming! …

"Men's verse"
_(Low pitched)_
Swing low, sweet chariot.
Cumming! [Snoring]

"Marcel Marceau"
_(Mimed, with only gestures, except every "coming" is preceded by a drawn out, 1–2 second long, throat-clearing grunt.)_

"Colorado Springs version"
Spring roll, fried in a wok,
Eat it while you're on your way home.
Spring roll, fried in a wok,
Eat it while you're on your way home.

I looked over the Pacific, and what did I see?
Tsunami! _(singing quickly)_ Now I'm running all the way home. _(running in place)_
Godzilla, Mothra, coming after me,
And I'm running all the way home.

If you eat sushi instead of spring roll,
You'll be shitting _(squat)_ all the way home.
Tell all my friends, _(slowly)_ and my fami-ry:
Twatzilla's gonna eat you whole. _(chomping gesture with straight arms)_

_(The visiting hashers from the Springs usually only get in the first verse before the Boulder hashers get impatient, or the visitors are drunk and forget a line.)_

"Prince version"
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to swing low the sweet chariot that is my little red Corvette.
Electric word is beer, it means forever, and that's a mighty long time. For I have looked over Jordan and I saw [a hasher's name] naked, and it made doves cry.
So, when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills, you know the one, Doctor Make Everything Feel Good, you tell him to tell all my friends that I am cumming too.
Now let's go crazy.
