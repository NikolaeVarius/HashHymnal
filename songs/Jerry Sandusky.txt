Jerry Sandusky likes little boys.
Little boys like Jerry Sandusky. _(No they don't!)_
And he makes them laugh, _(Ha ha)_
And he makes them cry, _(Boo hoo)_
When he touches them in the shower.

_(Each time through, add one more motion, and keep doing them through the chorus, until you're doing them all.)_

With the right, _(Extend right arm)_
And the left, _(Extend left arm)_
And the right, _(Kick out right leg)_
And the left, _(Kick out left leg)_
And a hooh. _(Push hips back)_
And a hah. _(Thrust hips forward)_
