Tune: The Ash Grove

The Mayor of Bayswater
He had a lovely daughter
And the hairs of her dicky-di-do
Hung down to her knees

**Chorus**
And the hairs (And the hairs)
And the hairs (Fuck those hares!)
And the hairs of her dicky-di-do
hung down to her knees

**Verse**
[rhyming couplet]
And the hairs of her dicky-di-do
hung down to her knees

**Closing Verse**
One black one, one white one,
and one with a little shite on
And one with a little light on,
to show us the wayâ€¦

**Verses**
It took a Welsh miner
To find her vagin-er

That very same miner
He came out in Chin-er

She married an Italian
Who was hung like a fucking stallion

She divorced the Italian
And married the fucking stallion

She went down to Mexico
And starred in a donkey show

She moved to Seattle
And went down on cattle

I've touched them, I've stroked them
I've rolled them up and smoked them

I've smelt it, I've felt it
It's just like a piece of velvet

They're so soft and spongy
You can use them for a bungie

I folded her lips back
And pulled out a six pack

I drank down that six pack
And then put my empties back

It took a brontosaurus
to find her clitoris

Her bush was so tangled
Her firstborn was strangled
