Tune: Alouette

_(The RA singles out a good natured harriette to pose as an example.  After each chorus they point out and ask about a new body part, which turns into a call-and-response working back through previously named body parts, then looping back to the chorus.)_

Alouette, gentille alouette,
Alouette, je te plumerai.

Does she have ze frizzy hair?
_Yes she has ze frizzy hair!_
Frizzy hair?
_Frizzy hair!_
Alouette, gentille…

Does she have ze furrowed brow?
_Yes she has ze furrowed brow!_
Furrowed brow?
_Furrowed brow!_
Frizzy hair?
_Frizzy hair!_
Alouette, gentille…

_(Keep adding body parts, working back through the whole list so far each time.)_

* Wooden eye? _(Reply, shouted: "Yes I would!")_
* Crooked nose?
* B-b-b-b-blowjob lips?
* Cum stained teeth?
* Double chin?
* Swinging tits?
* Beer belly?
* Furry thing?
* Knobby knees?
* Has she been a very good sport?
