Tune: The Candy man

**Chorus**
The S&M man,
The S&M man,
The S&M man, 'cause he mixes it with love,
Make the hurt feel good, makes the hurt feel good.

**Verses**

_(The first two lines are echoed back by the pack.)_

Who can take a puppy,
Grab it by the ears,
Fuck it in and out
Until it cries some puppy tears?

Who can take a cheese grater,
Strap it to his arm,
Fist her in and out
And make vagina parmesan?

Who can take a Catholic priest,
Bend him over a pew,
Fuck him in the ass
Until he swears that "I'm a Jew!"

Who can go to the abortion clinic,
Go around the back,
Root around the dumpster
Until he finds a tasty snack?

Who can go to the abortion clinic,
Screw going around the back,
Walk right in the front door
And grab a fresh one off the rack.

Who can take a belt sander,
Gotta be Black & Decker,
Rub it up and down
Until he doesn't have a pecker?

Who can take _[hasher's name]_,
Fill them full of lube,
Put them in a biker bar
Full of horny dudes?

Who can take a bicycle,
Rip off the seat,
Put _[hasher's name]_ on it,
And send them down a bumpy street?

Who can take a glass rod,
Shove it in his prick,
Give himself a stiffy,
And then smash it with a brick?
