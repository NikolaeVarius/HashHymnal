Title: North Atlantic Squadron
Tags: verse

**Chorus**
Away, away with the fife and the drum,
Here we come, all full of rum,
Looking for women to pat on the bum,
In the North Atlantic Squadron.

**Verses**

The Captain's name was Morgan,
He was a terrible gorgon.
Ten times a day, sweet tunes he'd play
On his enormous organ.

The first mate's name was Andy,
Good God, he had a dandy.
Till we crushed his cock with a jagged rock
For coming in the brandy.

The second mate was Hopper,
By Christ, he had a whopper.
Once round the deck, and twice round his neck,
And up his arse for a stopper.

The third mate's name was Higgins,
Good god, he had a big 'un.
Twice round the deck, once round his neck,
And use the rest for riggin'.

The fourth mate's name was Carter,
He was a terrible farter.
When the wind wouldn't blow, and the ship wouldn't go,
Carter the farter would start 'er.

The cabin boy, the cabin boy,
A cheerful little nipper.
He stuffed his ass with broken glass,
And circumcised the skipper.

The ship's cook's name was Freeman
He was a terrible demon.
He served the crew on menstrual stew
And foreskins fried in semen.

The captain's wife was Mabel.
When 'er she was able,
She'd give the crew their daily screw
Right on the galley table.

The captain's lovely daughters
Would swim in deep see waters.
By their delighted squeals you could the eels
Had found their sexual quarters.

The ship's dog's name was Rover,
The crew we screwed him over.
We ground and ground on that faithful hound
From Pickadilly to Dover.

Twas off South China Station,
To great admiration,
The crew sunk a junk with a load of spunk
By mutual masturbation.
