Tune: She’ll be Comin’ Round the Mountain

Oh, the eagles they fly high in Mobile. _(In Mobile!)_
Oh, the eagles they fly high in Mobile. _(In Mobile!)_
Oh, the eagles they fly high,
And they'll shit right in your eye;
You thank God that cows don't fly,
In Mobile!

In Mobile, in Mobile, _(Fuck, shit, piss)_
In Mo-, in Mo-, in Mo-, in Mobile.
Oh, the eagles they fly high,
And they'll shit right in your eye;
You thank God that cows don't fly,
In Mobile!

*Verses*

The Sherif is a bugger,
And his deputy's another,
And they bugger one another…

There's a lack of clean glasses,
'Cause those mother-fucking hashers
Stick the glasses in their asses…

The women wear tin undies,
But they takes 'em off on Sundays;
You should see the boys on Mondays…

There's a lack of good whores,
But there's keyholes in the doors,
And there's knotholes in the floors…

They built a brand new lighthouse,
But birds used it as a shite-house,
Now the lighthouse is a white house…

There's a lack of shit-paper,
So they hold it till it's vapor,
And they light it with a taper…

If you ever are in jail,
And you are in need of tail,
Well, the Sherif's wife's for sale…

Oh the cows are all dead,
But the children must be fed,
So they milk the bulls instead…
