Title: Chicago
Tags: verse, location
AKA: I Used to Work in Chicago
Tune: For He's A Jolly Good Fellow

**Chorus**
I used to work in Chicago,
At the old department store.
I used to work in Chicago;
I don't work there anymore.

**Verses:**
A man/woman came in for [something innocuous],
_[Something innocuous] from the store._
[Something innocuous] they wanted, a [double entendre] they got,
I don't work there anymore. 

_(The second line is done as a response from the whole pack.  Sometimes the [something innocuous] in the third line is the same as in the first two, other times it's a specific example.)_

* A hammer / nailed
* A nail / screwed
* Flowers / roses / my two-lips
* Craft beer / a six-pack / ate
* Electronics / a hard drive / my 3.5" floppy
* A ruler / my twelve inches
* A muffler / my muff
* A donut / glazed / cream filled
* Seafood / my crabs
* A steel bathtub / a golden shower
* Metaphysical conversation / _Fucked_

_(Since this song can go on for quite some time, we'll often switch after a bit to just doing verses, best if newly composed, where the punchline is the name of a hasher present, who then joins those in the circle.  See if you can get everyone.)_
