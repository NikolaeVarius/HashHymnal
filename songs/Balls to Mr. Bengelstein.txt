Title: Balls to Mr. Bengelstein
AKA: A Prayer
Tags: penis, hymn
Tune: O du lieber Augustin (after spoken call-and-response portion)

A prayer, a prayer, a prayer for the dehydrated:
_Beer!_
A prayer, a prayer, a prayer for the inebriated:
_Piss!_
A prayer, a prayer, a prayer for the constipated:
_Shit!_
A prayer, a prayer, a prayer for the frustrated:
_Fuck!_
A prayer, a prayer, a prayer for the menstruated:
_Bloody hell!_
A prayer, a prayer, a prayer for the castrated:
_Balls!_

Balls to Mr. Bengelstein, Bengelstein, Bengelstein,
Balls to Mr. Bengelstein, dirty old man.

He sits on the steeple and shits on the people,
Balls to Mr. Bengelstein, dirty old man.

He keeps us all waiting while he's masturbating,
Balls to Mr. Bengelstein, dirty old man.

He ups it, he downs it, he fucking well pounds it.
Balls to Mr. Bengelstein, dirty old man.
